# Things i must do

- Follow a TDD approach

- Use GitHub or an alternative to add features to your prototype or MVP gradually. (Git Workflow)

- Maintain the ticketing system to keep the documentation up-to-date. Conventionally, one ticket is one feature corresponding to one branch
and one pull request. Bug tickets are documented differently from feature tickets.
